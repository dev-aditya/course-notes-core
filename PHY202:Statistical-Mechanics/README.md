## Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics

I made these notes while following lectures by [Leonard Susskind](https://theoreticalminimum.com/about). The video lectures
can be found on [this webpage](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/statistical-mechanics/2013/spring) or [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1RzvXDXyqA&list=PL_IkS0viawhr3HcKH607rXbVqy28W_gB7)

I've also included brief (precisely written) notes on [Foundations of Thermodynamics](https://github.com/dev-aditya/course-notes-core/blob/master/PHY202:Statistical-Mechanics/Foundations_of_Thermodynamics.pdf).
