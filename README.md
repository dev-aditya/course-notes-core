# Course Notes

This repository contains course notes typesetted in LaTeX, for core year. They are not complete (or may contain errors), 
but might pe helpful. So, I keep it here. *The templates used in making these notes can be found [here](https://github.com/dev-aditya/LaTeX-template)*

**Please feel free to share and edit the notes. Create an issue or PR in case you find any typographical errors or any other problem.**
*Feel free to [email me](mailto:adityadev21.ad@gmail.com) if you find these notes/text useful :blush:*
